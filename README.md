## React Native File Upload with Expo to Supabase Storage

This app is using the expo-router and Supabase to upload files to Supabase Storage.

Routes are protected by Supabase Auth.

### Configuration

```
Make sure to include your own Supabase keys inside the config .env 

Also create a new bucket files inside Supabase Storage, and use the create-policy.sql
